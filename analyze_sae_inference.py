TODO:
We have 430k documents processed.

The goals of this script are:
- Let's build data structures to analyze activations
- Let's build auto-interp tools to find meaning within activations
- Let's build visualization tools to see what the features are doing

Out-of-scope:
- Another script should work on running LM inference with SAE features
clamped to specified activation.
